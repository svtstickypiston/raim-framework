                        <p>Users might want to know statistics like the genre and period of music used for training, as this can reveal potential biases in the AI model. Before using the system, users could be allowed to access training data statistics to understand the type of music the AI is likely to generate to encourage transparency and informed use.</p>
                        <p>This is about understanding the AI's "musical background."  If the AI was only trained on Western classical music, it's likely to struggle with generating other genres, like hip-hop or traditional folk music.  Providing statistics about the training data helps users understand the AI's potential biases and limitations. It promotes transparency about the diversity (or lack thereof) in the AI's musical knowledge.</p>
