    "feature_brief": "The system warns users if it might generate music that could be considered offensive or harmful.",
    "feature_summary": "A safety disclaimer would warn users of potential risks from harmful or offensive AI-generated content, helping to prevent harm and reduce legal issues. Upon starting, users would see an explanation and must confirm they understand the risks before proceeding.",
    "feature_use_case": "Just like some movies come with content warnings, this feature ensures the AI provides a heads-up if the music it's about to generate might contain something that some people would find upsetting. This could include offensive language in lyrics, extremely dissonant or disturbing sounds, or content that promotes harmful ideas.  This is important for protecting users from unexpected and potentially negative experiences, and it shows that the developers are thinking about the potential impact of their AI.",
    "feature_long": "This is not preventing certain outputs, it is about making users aware of certain behaviours. This feature ensures that you're aware of the *potential* for the system to generate music that some might find offensive or inappropriate. Before you start using the system, or when you select certain options, it will provide a clear disclaimer. This might say something like, \"This system may generate lyrics containing strong language,\" or \"The music generated might be experimental and include dissonant sounds.\" This allows you to make an informed decision about whether and how to use the system, especially if you're sensitive to certain types of content or are sharing the music with others."
