    "feature_brief": "The system can adapt its musical style based on a user's own musical repertoire.",
    "feature_summary": "Personalisation allows a musician to create stylised music based on their existing repertoire, and the user will be able to influence the output of the system by personalising it based on certain songs.",
    "feature_use_case": "Imagine a music-making AI that learns *your* specific sound. This feature means the AI can analyze the music you've created or a collection of music you provide, and then use that understanding to generate new music that fits your personal style.  It's like having an AI collaborator that speaks your musical language. This is important because it gives *you* more creative control and makes the AI feel more like a partner than a replacement.  It goes beyond just picking a genre; it's about capturing the nuances of your individual artistic voice.",
    "feature_long": "Imagine having a musical collaborator that learns your unique style. Personalisation in generative music AI means the model/system can ingest your existing music - your favorite songs, your own compositions, or even just snippets of melodies you like - and use that information to create new music that aligns with the given style. This isn't about copying your music; it's about understanding your preferences for things like melody, harmony, and rhythm. The system effectively learns your 'musical fingerprint' and uses that to generate something fresh, but still feels like *your* kind of music. This feature helps ensure that the AI acts as an extension of your own creativity, rather than a generic music-making machine."
