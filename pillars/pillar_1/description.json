    "brief": "Central to the design of trustworthy systems is the capacity of individuals to understand and meaningfully influence the actions of AI systems (<em>human agency</em>) while monitoring and interacting their behaviour to operate responsibly and align with human values and preferences (<em>human oversight</em>).",
    "description": "This requirement ensures that users maintain control over AI systems and their outputs. This translates to features that support user understanding of the systemâ€™s capabilities and limitations, offer control over the generative process (e.g., through interactive feedback and multi-modal conditioning), and prioritise user safety by providing safeguards against potentially harmful or inappropriate musical outputs.",
