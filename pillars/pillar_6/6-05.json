    "feature_brief": "The system has mechanisms to detect if it's accidentally copying existing music or infringing on intellectual property.",
    "feature_summary": "The AI system could measure how much it copies from its training data to try and improve its societal responsibility. Tools like the \"originality report\", a framework for assessing copying extent, could help detect plagiarism and intellectual property infringement in AI-generated music, ensuring ethical and legal compliance.",
    "feature_use_case": "This is a more advanced form of plagiarism detection.  The system should have ways to check if the music it generates is too similar to existing copyrighted works. This is important for protecting the rights of human artists and for avoiding legal problems.  It might involve comparing the generated music to large databases of existing songs.",
    "feature_long": "This is a crucial safeguard against copyright violations. The system should not simply reproduce existing copyrighted material. This feature means implementing mechanisms to detect potential plagiarism. This might involve: (1) Comparing generated music to a database of copyrighted works. (2) Using algorithms to identify melodic or rhythmic patterns that are too similar to existing songs. (3) Providing tools for users to check the originality of the generated music. This proactive approach helps to protect the rights of artists and prevent the unintentional creation of infringing content."
