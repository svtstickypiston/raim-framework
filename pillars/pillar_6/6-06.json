    "feature_brief": "If the system is a paid service, some of the revenue is shared with the artists whose music was used for training.",
    "feature_summary": "Remunerating artists whose music is used in AI systems is may be important to support their creative work and ensure fair compensation. If the AI system is paid-for, a percentage of its profits could be allocated to contributing artists. This could also fund support for creators impacted by generative AI.",
    "feature_use_case": "This is about fairness and compensation.  If an AI system is making money by generating music, and that music is based on the work of human artists, those artists should receive a share of the profits. This feature ensures that there's a mechanism for distributing revenue fairly, acknowledging the contribution of the original creators.",
    "feature_long": "This addresses the complex issue of fair compensation in the age of AI-generated music. If the system generates revenue (e.g., through subscriptions or licensing fees), this feature proposes that a portion of that revenue should be shared with the artists whose music was used to train the AI. This is a challenging problem, as it's difficult to determine exactly *how much* each artist contributed to the success of the system. However, exploring models for revenue sharing is a crucial step towards ensuring that AI development benefits not just the technology companies, but also the creative community whose work makes it possible. This might involve creating a fund, developing a licensing scheme, or other innovative solutions."
