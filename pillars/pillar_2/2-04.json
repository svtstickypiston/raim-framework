    "feature_brief": "The AI-generated music is evaluated for its musical qualities.",
    "feature_summary": "User may wish to understand the musical properties of AI-generated content, such as key, chords, and tempo. After generation, the system could provide a summary of these statistics, offering insights into the musicâ€™s structure and characteristics.",
    "feature_use_case": "This goes beyond basic technical checks.  It's about assessing the music itself: Is it pleasant to listen to? Does it have a good structure? Does it evoke emotions? Does it follow basic principles of music theory (unless intentionally breaking them)?  This evaluation can involve both objective measures (e.g., analyzing the harmony) and subjective opinions (e.g., asking people to rate the music).",
    "feature_long": "This goes beyond simply saying \"the music sounds good.\" It means the system's developers have thoroughly analysed the *musical characteristics* of the generated output. This might involve looking at things like melody, harmony, rhythm, structure, and timbre. They've likely used both objective metrics (e.g., calculating the complexity of the melody) and subjective evaluations (e.g., asking people to rate the music's pleasantness). This detailed analysis provides a clear picture of the system's strengths and weaknesses, going beyond superficial assessments."
