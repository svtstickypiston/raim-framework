    "feature_name": "Model Evaluation",
    "pillar_id": 2,
    "pillar": "Robustness and Safety",
    "facet": "Accuracy",
    "feature_brief": "The AI's performance is evaluated using standard methods and compared to other music AI systems.",
    "feature_summary": "Evaluating music generation is challenging due to its subjective nature. Assessment could be done using widely used methods from other models, combining objective metrics and subjective feedback (e.g., user ratings). This approach ensures a robust evaluation and comparison with similar systems.",
    "feature_use_case": "This is about making sure the AI is actually good at what it does.  Developers should use established methods to test the AI's ability to generate music that is coherent, interesting, and meets certain quality standards.  They should also compare its performance to other similar AI systems to see how it stacks up. This helps users understand the AI's strengths and weaknesses and ensures that it's not just a gimmick.",
    "feature_long": "This ensures that the AI's performance is measured objectively and comparably. There are established ways of evaluating generative music systems, looking at things like musicality, originality, and similarity to a given style. This feature means the developers have used these standard methods, allowing their system to be fairly compared to others. This helps researchers and users understand how well the system performs relative to the state-of-the-art and promotes healthy competition and improvement in the field."
