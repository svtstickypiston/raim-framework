    "feature_brief": "The AI doesn't accidentally reproduce parts of the music it was trained on.",
    "feature_summary": "To avoid copyright issues, it may be useful to ensure AI-generated music doesnâ€™t reproduce training data without permission. This could involve tracking copyright information for all training data and comparing outputs to the training set. If similarity exceeds a threshold, the system would question copyright validity and discard the output if necessary.",
    "feature_use_case": "This is a crucial safeguard against plagiarism.  The AI should be designed to generate *new* music, not just copy and paste existing songs.  This feature ensures that the AI doesn't accidentally reveal copyrighted material from its training data, protecting the rights of human artists.",
    "feature_long": "This is about protecting the intellectual property of artists from potential leaks. The AI is trained on a large dataset of music. This feature ensures the system doesn't simply memorise and regurgitate pieces of that training data. It should generate *new* music, not copy existing works. If, for some reason, the system *does* reproduce part of its training data, it must be transparent about this and only do so with the explicit permission of the copyright holders. This prevents plagiarism and respects the rights of the original creators."
