    "pillar_id": 2,
    "pillar": "Robustness and Safety",
    "facet": "Reproducibility",
    "feature_brief": "The music data used to train the AI is publicly accessible.",
    "feature_summary": "Releasing the training data for the system could increase the transparency of the system, as it might be useful for users to understand the source material that the software draws on.",
    "feature_use_case": "This is important for understanding where the AI's \"musical knowledge\" comes from.  If the training data is available, others can see what kind of music the AI was exposed to, which can help explain its biases and limitations.  It also allows for scrutiny of the data for potential copyright issues.",
    "feature_long": "This is another crucial aspect of reproducibility and transparency. If the training data is publicly available (while respecting copyright, of course), other researchers can: (1) Understand the potential biases in the system, as the training data strongly influences the system's output. (2) Try to replicate the training process. (3) Potentially improve the system by using a modified or expanded dataset. It's important to note that in many cases, full training data availability might not be possible due to copyright restrictions, but where feasible, it significantly enhances scientific openness."
