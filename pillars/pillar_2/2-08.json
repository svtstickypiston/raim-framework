    "pillar": "Robustness and Safety",
    "facet": "Reproducibility",
    "feature_brief": "If examples of AI-generated music are provided, the AI can be made to recreate those exact pieces.",
    "feature_summary": "Establishing a direct link between user prompts (and seeded training data) and system outputs may enhances transparency and reproducibility. It also shifts more creative control to the user, preserving the \"human spirit\" in the generated music.",
    "feature_use_case": "This means the AI's output isn't completely random.  If you see an example of music generated by the AI that you like, you should be able to give the AI the same starting point (the \"prompt\") and get the same result.  This is important for demonstrating the AI's capabilities and for allowing users to experiment with different prompts to see how they affect the output.",
    "feature_long": "This means that if the developers release examples of music generated by the system, they also provide the exact 'prompts' (instructions) and 'seeds' (random starting points) that were used. This allows others to run the same model and, in principle, obtain the *exact* same output. This is a strong test of reproducibility. It demonstrates that the system's behaviour is deterministic (given the same inputs, it produces the same outputs) and that the reported results are genuine. It guards against cherry-picking the best results and helps build confidence in the system's reliability."
