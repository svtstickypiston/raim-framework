    "feature_num": "06",
    "feature_name": "Model Availability",
    "pillar_id": 2,
    "pillar": "Robustness and Safety",
    "facet": "Reproducibility",
    "feature_brief": "The AI model's code and pre-trained versions are publicly accessible.",
    "feature_summary": "Publicly releasing the model could improve transparency, allowing users to understand how the AI system works. This openness may help build trust, as people can see firsthand how the system generates content, reinforcing its credibility as a \"trustworthy\" AI.",
    "feature_use_case": "This is about transparency and allowing others to build upon the work.  If the AI's code and a version that's already been trained are available, other researchers and developers can examine it, learn from it, improve it, or even use it to create their own systems. This promotes collaboration and accelerates innovation in the field.",
    "feature_long": "This is about openness and scientific rigour. Making the model's code and pre-trained parameters (checkpoints) publicly available allows other researchers to: (1) Verify the results claimed by the developers. (2) Build upon the work, improving the system or adapting it for new purposes. (3) Understand the inner workings of the system, contributing to transparency and trust. This fosters collaboration and accelerates progress in the field."
