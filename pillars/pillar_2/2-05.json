    "feature_name": "Expert Evaluation",
    "pillar_id": 2,
    "pillar": "Robustness and Safety",
    "facet": "Accuracy",
    "feature_brief": "Professional musicians or music experts have evaluated the AI's music.",
    "feature_summary": "Involving creative professionals in evaluation could ensure the system meets ethical standards and produces musically plausible outputs. A panel of music experts could provide feedback on both ethical considerations and the quality of the generated music.",
    "feature_use_case": "This is a crucial step to ensure the AI-generated music is not just technically correct, but also artistically meaningful.  Getting feedback from experienced musicians helps to identify areas where the AI might be lacking in creativity, originality, or emotional depth.  Their expertise provides a valuable perspective that goes beyond what automated tests can measure.",
    "feature_long": "While objective metrics are important, human judgment is crucial in evaluating music. This feature means that the developers haven't just relied on algorithms to assess their system. They've also involved musicians, composers, or musicologists - people with deep musical knowledge and experience - to listen to the generated music and provide their expert opinions. This provides a valuable qualitative perspective, ensuring that the system is evaluated not just on technical grounds, but also on its artistic merit."
