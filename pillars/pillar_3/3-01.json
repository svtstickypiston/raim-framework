    "feature_brief": "The AI system doesn't share or reveal the prompts (instructions) that users give it.",
    "feature_summary": "To prevent leaks of sensitive data, the system could delete user prompts shortly after use and screen both inputs and outputs for personal information. This minimizes the risk of sensitive data being exposed in the AI-generated content.",
    "feature_use_case": "This is about protecting your privacy.  The prompts you give the AI might contain personal information, creative ideas, or other sensitive data.  This feature ensures that this information is kept confidential and not shared with others without your consent. It's like keeping your diary private.",
    "feature_long": "This is a fundamental privacy protection. When you give the system instructions (prompts) - whether it's text, a melody you hum, or other data - that information should remain private. This feature guarantees that the system doesn't share your prompts with others, store them insecurely, or use them in a way that could reveal your personal information. It's about respecting your privacy and ensuring that your creative process remains confidential."
