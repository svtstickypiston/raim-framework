    "feature_name": "Training Metadata Integrity",
    "pillar_id": 3,
    "pillar": "Privacy and Data Governance",
    "facet": "Data quality",
    "feature_brief": "The system checks and communicates if the music it was trained on has correct information about its creators and copyright.",
    "feature_summary": "To avoid copyright violations from misattributed training data, the system could store copyright information and warn users of potential issues before they use it. This prepares them for the possibility of copyright concerns related to the generated music.",
    "feature_use_case": "Metadata is like the \"label\" on a piece of music, providing information like the artist, composer, album, and copyright holder. This feature means the AI system verifies that this information is accurate for the music it uses for training. It should also let you know if it finds errors or incomplete metadata. This is crucial for ensuring that artists are properly credited and that copyright is respected.",
    "feature_long": "This is about transparency regarding the *source* of the AI's musical knowledge. The system should inform you if the music it was trained on has incomplete or inaccurate metadata. Metadata is information *about* the music, like the composer, title, and copyright holder. If the metadata is flawed, it raises concerns about copyright infringement and the potential for the AI to learn from incorrectly attributed works. This feature is a warning sign that the system's training data might not be ethically sound."
