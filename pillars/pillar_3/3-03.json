    "feature_brief": "The system warns users if it was trained on music that might be considered offensive or harmful.",
    "feature_summary": "To prevent offensive outputs, the system could check training data for harmful content before generation. If detected, it would warn the user, ensuring they are aware of potential risks and can proceed with caution.",
    "feature_use_case": "This is about transparency and informed consent.  If the AI was trained on music with offensive lyrics, violent themes, or other potentially problematic content, the system should let you know.  This allows you to make an informed decision about whether you want to use the system and what kind of output you might expect.",
    "feature_long": "Just as the system should warn about potential copyright issues, it should also warn you if it was trained on music containing potentially offensive content. This might include lyrics with hate speech, violent themes, or other harmful material. This transparency allows you to make an informed decision about using the system, knowing that its output *could* reflect those problematic elements from its training data. It's a proactive step towards responsible AI development."
