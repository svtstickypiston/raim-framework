    "feature_name": "Generative Redress",
    "pillar_id": 7,
    "pillar": "Accountability",
    "facet": "Redress",
    "feature_brief": "If the system creates harmful or inappropriate output, there are ways to address the problem.",
    "feature_summary": "The generative system could offer redress mechanisms when it fails to meet responsible expectations (e.g. producing offensive content or plagiarizing training material). This could include compensation, direct corrections through feedback, legal support, and other accountability measures for users, artists, and stakeholders.",
    "feature_use_case": "This is about having a plan for when things go wrong.  If the AI generates offensive content, plagiarizes music, or causes other harm, there should be a way for users to report the problem and for the developers to take action.  This might involve removing the offending content, compensating affected parties, or improving the AI to prevent similar issues in the future.",
    "feature_long": "Despite best efforts, things can still go wrong. This feature addresses what happens *after* a negative impact has occurred. It means having mechanisms in place to provide redress - to make amends for the harm caused. This could involve: (1) **Compensation:** Providing financial compensation to someone harmed by copyright infringement. (2) **Correction:** Allowing users to directly modify or remove offensive content generated by the system. (3) **Apology:** Issuing a public apology for the harm caused. (4) **System Modification:** Updating the system to prevent similar incidents in the future. The specific form of redress will depend on the nature of the harm, but the key is having a plan in place to address negative consequences fairly and effectively."
