    "feature_brief": "The system involves musicians, ethicists, and AI experts in ongoing evaluation and improvement.",
    "feature_summary": "To address the long-term effects of AI in music, stakeholders like musicians, ethicists, and AI experts could regularly assess the systemâ€™s impact after deployment. Periodic studies would evaluate its influence on the industry and identify necessary improvements to enhance its trustworthiness and ethical standing.",
    "feature_use_case": "This means the AI isn't just developed and then forgotten.  There's a continuous process of checking how it's performing, getting feedback from different groups of people (including those who create and use music), and making improvements based on that feedback. This ensures that the AI stays relevant, responsible, and beneficial over time.",
    "feature_long": "Responsible AI development is not a one-time effort; it requires ongoing monitoring and evaluation. This feature emphasises the importance of involving a diverse group of stakeholders - musicians, composers, ethicists, AI experts, and potentially even representatives from different cultural groups - in a continuous process of assessing the system. This ongoing feedback loop helps to: (1) Identify and address any emerging biases or unintended consequences. (2) Ensure the system remains aligned with ethical principles and societal values. (3) Improve the system's performance and usefulness over time. It's a commitment to long-term responsibility and continuous improvement."
