The goal is to make music creation accessible to as many people as possible, regardless of their abilities.",
    "feature_long": "This is about making the AI usable by people with a wide range of abilities and disabilities. 'Accessible interfaces' might include: (1) **Multiple input methods:** Allowing users to interact with the system not just through text, but also through voice, images, musical instruments, or other modalities. (2) **Customisable output:** Providing options to adjust the tempo, volume, or visual representation of the music. (3) **Support for assistive technologies:** Ensuring compatibility with screen readers, alternative input devices, and other tools used by people with disabilities. The goal is to remove barriers and make the creative process inclusive for everyone."
