    "feature_brief": "Users are always aware that they are interacting with an AI, not a human.",
    "feature_summary": "To ensure users understand theyâ€™re interacting with an AI system, not a human, they could be shown an information screen before use. This screen would explain how the music generation system works, and users might confirm they understand it before proceeding to help set clear expectations and avoid misconceptions.",
    "feature_use_case": "This is a basic principle of ethical AI. It should be clear to users at all times that they are interacting with a machine, not a person. This prevents deception and helps users set appropriate expectations.",
    "feature_long": "This is a basic principle when interacting with an AI. Users should *never* be misled into thinking they are interacting with a human when they are interacting with an AI. The system should be clearly identified as an AI, both at the beginning of the interaction and throughout the process. This prevents deception and maintains user trust."
