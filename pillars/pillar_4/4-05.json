    "pillar": "Transparency",
    "facet": "Explainability",
    "feature_brief": "The system can show which parts of its training data influenced a particular piece of generated music.",
    "feature_summary": "Matching training material to specific generations can help users understand how the AI constructs its outputs. This transparency builds confidence and makes the system more approachable, as users can easily trace and piece together the generation process.",
    "feature_use_case": "This is about tracing the AI's \"inspiration.\"  If the AI generates a melody that sounds similar to a particular song in its training data, it should be able to point to that song as a potential source of influence.  This is important for understanding the AI's creative process and for identifying potential copyright issues.",
    "feature_long": "This is a deeper level of explainability. Ideally, the system could point to specific parts of its training data that influenced the generated music. For example, it might say, \"This melody is similar to a phrase found in this particular song in the training set,\" or \"The rhythmic pattern is based on this specific drum loop.\" This provides valuable insight into the AI's creative process and helps to understand where its musical ideas are coming from. It also helps in identifying potential copyright concerns if the generated music is too similar to specific training examples."
