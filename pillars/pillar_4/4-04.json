    "feature_brief": "The system can explain *how* it created a particular piece of music.",
    "feature_summary": "Most users of music generation software, like musicians or music listeners, may not be AI experts. To improve transparency, the system could use concepts like harmonic memory, which generates chord sequences from user prompts. This approach is easier for musicians to understand and aligns with their existing knowledge.",
    "feature_use_case": "This goes beyond just saying \"the AI made it.\"  The system should provide some insight into its creative process.  For example, it might explain which musical elements it focused on, what rules it followed, or what kind of inspiration it drew from.  This helps users understand *why* the music sounds the way it does and makes the AI feel less like a \"black box.\"pillar",
    "feature_long": "This moves beyond simply *knowing* that the music is AI-generated; it's about understanding *how* the AI created it. The level of explanation should be appropriate for the intended users. For example, a musician might want a more technical explanation (e.g., which musical patterns were used), while a casual listener might just want a general overview (e.g., \"The AI created a melody based on your humming and then added chords in a similar style.\"). This promotes trust and allows users to better understand the AI's capabilities and limitations."
