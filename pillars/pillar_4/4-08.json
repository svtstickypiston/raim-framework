    "feature_brief": "The system clearly explains its technical limitations and potential risks.",
    "feature_summary": "To promote informed use, users could be shown an information screen before using the system, outlining its technical and ethical limitations. This educates users on the systemâ€™s constraints, encouraging realistic expectations when engaging with AI music generation tools.",
    "feature_use_case": "This is about being honest about what the AI *can't* do. It might struggle with certain genres of music, it might produce repetitive or unoriginal results, or it might be vulnerable to certain types of errors. This helps users set realistic expectations and avoid disappointment.",
    "feature_long": "Just as important as highlighting the benefits is being transparent about the system's *limitations*. No AI system is perfect. This feature ensures that users are aware of what the system *cannot* do, or where it might produce unsatisfactory results. This might include limitations on the styles of music it can generate, potential biases in its output, or the risk of generating unoriginal or even offensive content. Honest communication about limitations builds trust and prevents unrealistic expectations."
