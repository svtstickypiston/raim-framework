    "feature_name": "Artefact Watermarking",
    "pillar_id": 4,
    "pillar": "Transparency",
    "facet": "Traceability",
    "feature_brief": "The AI automatically adds a \"watermark\" to the music it generates to identify it as AI-created.",
    "feature_summary": "Watermarking AI-generated music helps distinguish it from human compositions and prevents misuse, such as deepfakes or copyright violations. Tools like Meta’s AudioSeal can add imperceptible watermarks detectable only by specialized software, ensuring traceability and accountability for AI-created content.",
    "feature_use_case": "This is like a digital signature that identifies the music as being generated by an AI, not a human.  The watermark might be an inaudible signal embedded in the audio, or it could be a visible label.  This is important for preventing deception and for ensuring that people know when they're listening to AI-generated music.",
    "feature_long": "This is about clearly identifying AI-generated music as such. A 'watermark' in this context might be an inaudible signal embedded in the audio, or a visible marker if the music is represented as a score. This helps prevent the music from being mistaken for human-composed music, addressing potential concerns about deception or misuse. It's a simple but effective way to ensure transparency about the origin of the music."
