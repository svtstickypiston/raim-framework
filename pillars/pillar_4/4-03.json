    "pillar": "Transparency",
    "facet": "Traceability",
    "feature_brief": "The AI automatically adds a \"watermark\" to the music it generates to identify it as AI-created.",
    "feature_summary": "Watermarking AI-generated music helps distinguish it from human compositions and prevents misuse, such as deepfakes or copyright violations. Tools like Metaâ€™s AudioSeal can add imperceptible watermarks detectable only by specialized software, ensuring traceability and accountability for AI-created content.",
    "feature_use_case": "This is like a digital signature that identifies the music as being generated by an AI, not a human.  The watermark might be an inaudible signal embedded in the audio, or it could be a visible label.  This is important for preventing deception and for ensuring that people know when they're listening to AI-generated music.",
    "feature_long": "This is about clearly identifying AI-generated music as such. A 'watermark' in this context might be an inaudible signal embedded in the audio, or a visible marker if the music is represented as a score. This helps prevent the music from being mistaken for human-composed music, addressing potential concerns about deception or misuse. It's a simple but effective way to ensure transparency about the origin of the music."
