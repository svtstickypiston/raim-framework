    "feature_name": "Evaluation Documentation",
    "pillar_id": 4,
    "pillar": "Transparency",
    "facet": "Traceability",
    "feature_brief": "The methods used to evaluate the AI's performance are clearly documented and reproducible.",
    "feature_summary": "Proper documentation during evaluation is may be useful for transparency, ensuring honesty and demonstrating thorough, unbiased assessment. This includes detailing the modelâ€™s performance, use cases, and potential biases, all of which could be clearly documented to maintain trust and accountability.",
    "feature_use_case": "This is about showing your work.  The documentation should explain *how* the AI's music was evaluated, what metrics were used, and what the results were.  This allows others to verify the claims made about the AI's quality and to compare it to other systems.",
    "feature_long": "This builds upon the previous point, focusing specifically on *how* the system's performance was evaluated. The documentation should clearly describe the evaluation methods, the metrics used, the datasets involved, and the results obtained. This allows others to: (1) Verify the evaluation process. (2) Compare the system's performance to other systems using the same evaluation methods. (3) Conduct future evaluations in a consistent and transparent manner. This promotes scientific rigor and comparability across different AI music systems."
