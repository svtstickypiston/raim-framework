            <p>Central to the design of trustworthy systems is the capacity of individuals to understand and meaningfully influence the actions of AI systems (<em>human agency</em>) while monitoring and interacting their behaviour to operate responsibly and align with human values and preferences (<em>human oversight</em>).</p>
            <p>This requirement ensures that users maintain control over AI systems and their outputs. This translates to features that support user understanding of the systemâ€™s capabilities and limitations, offer control over the generative process (e.g., through interactive feedback and multi-modal conditioning), and prioritise user safety by providing safeguards against potentially harmful or inappropriate musical outputs.</p>

This feature means the AI can analyze the music you've created or a collection of music you provide, and then use that understanding to generate new music that fits your personal style.  It's like having an AI collaborator that speaks your musical language. This is important because it gives *you* more creative control and makes the AI feel more like a partner than a replacement.  It goes beyond just picking a genre; it's about capturing the nuances of your individual artistic voice.</p>                    </div>                </div>                </div>

Instead, you can listen to what it's creating *while* it's creating it, and give feedback like "more upbeat," "change the key," or "add a drum solo."  The AI then adjusts the music based on your feedback, leading to a more collaborative and satisfying creative process.

Instead of just saying "make me a song," you can provide specific guidance.

If an AI generates a piece of music that sounds very similar to an existing song, it shouldn't pretend it's completely original.  It should be clear about whether the music is entirely new, inspired by existing works, or potentially infringing on someone else's copyright. This is crucial for protecting the rights of human artists and for preventing legal problems.  It also helps users understand what they can and can't do with the AI-generated music (e.g., can they use it commercially?).</p>                    </div>                </div>                </div>
