              <p class="mb-0">Generative AI is radically changing the creative arts, transforming the way we create and interact with artworks.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>While offering unprecedented opportunities for artistic expression, this technology also raises ethical, societal, and legal concerns. Key among these are the potential displacement of human creativity, copyright infringement stemming from vast training datasets, and the lack of transparency, explainability, and fairness mechanisms. In response to this, a coalition of organisations representing creative industries formed the  <a class="lolink" href="https://www.humanartistrycampaign.com">Human Artistry Campaign</a>, advocating on behalf of the responsible use of creative AI. As generative systems become pervasive in this domain, responsible design is crucial.</p>

            <p><span class="font-weight-bold">Responsible AI Music</span> (RAIM) is a collaborative initiative bringing together musicians, AI experts, ethicists, and legal experts to define, expand, and monitor requirements for generative music AI. Our goal is to work towards a framework providing guidance on the responsible development and use of generative models and system for music. By balancing innovation with ethical considerations, we advocate for a tradeoff where artists and AI development collaborate in a way that <span class="font-italic">safeguards</span>, <span class="font-italic">inspires</span>, and <span class="font-italic">augments</span> human creativity and artistry.</p>

            <p><span class="font-weight-bold">Can this be done by leveraging a Trustworthy AI framework?</span> This initiative takes a holistic approach, harmonising previous work that has tackled specific aspects of generative systems (e.g., transparency, evaluation, data), within the Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI produced by the European Commission - a framework for designing responsible AI systems across 7 macro requirements. Focusing on generative music AI, we illustrate how these requirements can be contextualised for the field, addressing trustworthiness across multiple dimensions and integrating insights from the existing literature.</p>

            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-lg-8">
                <p>Trustworthy AI encompasses artificial intelligence systems designed and implemented to adhere to fundamental ethical principles, technical robustness, and legal compliance.
                A referential work in this domain are the <a href="https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/d3988569-0434-11ea-8c1f-01aa75ed71a1">Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence</a>, a document prepared by the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/expert-group-ai">High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence</a>, an independent expert group appointed by the European Commission in 2018.</p>
                <p>The guidelines include 7 key requirements that AI systems should meet to be trustworthy:
                <ol>
                    <li>Human agency and oversight</li>
                    <li>Robustness and safety</li>
                    <li>Privacy and data governance</li>
                    <li>Transparency</li>
                    <li>Diversity, non-discrimination, fairness</li>
                    <li>Societal and environmental well-being</li>
                    <li>Accountability</li>
                </ol>
                These requirements are of general applicability and relate to different stakeholders in the systems' life cycle (developers, deployers, end-users, broader society). Following a piloting process with 350 stakeholders, the guidelines lead to the creation of the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/assessment-list-trustworthy-artificial-intelligence-altai-self-assessment">Assessment list for Trustworthy AI (ALTAI)</a>.</p>

            <h2>Guiding features for Responsible AI Music</h2>
            <p>We contextualise the Trustworthy AI framework to the domain of Generative AI Music, by defining responsible features that can drive the design and the evaluation of generative systems, in accordance with the literature.</p>
            <img src="assets/feature_diagram.png" class="img-fluid my-2" alt="Overview of features">

            <p>Before presenting each feature, let's start by introducing some jargon. When referring to Music AIs, a distinction needs to be made between <span class="font-italic">music model</span> and <span class="font-italic">generative music system</span>.
            <ul>
                <li>
                A music <span class="font-weight-bold">model</span> can be defined as an algorithmic procedure that either encodes a set of rules explicitly, or learns them from the data and the task it is provided. These rules, e.g., a probability distribution for predicting the next note or chord in a piece, or a set of logical statements, can be used to generate, complete, or manipulate music.
                </li>
                <li>
                A generative music <span class="font-weight-bold">system</span> encompasses the whole computational infrastructure built on top of a music model to enable users to interact with the model and make use of its outputs, without the need of its inner workings. This includes both technical and the regulatory aspects, such as the interface, the logic which abstract or hide certain parameters of the model, the way the model's predictions are consumed; but also the data management system, the legal framework regulating the exchange of data, etc.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Typically, a generative system is implemented in such a way as to conveniently wrap the functionalities of a particular model, meaning that a model can provide the computational backbone to various generative systems (e.g., plugins for music editors, production environments, smart instruments).
            For example, <a href="https://magenta.tensorflow.org/music-vae">MusicVAE</a> has been reused in different applications, such as Beat Blender, Melody Mixer, Latent Loops, and is also available through <a href="https://magenta.tensorflow.org/studio/">Magenta Studio</a>, a plugin for the DAW Ableton Live.
            The distinction between model and system is a peculiar aspect to Generative AI, as their design and implementation involve different stakeholders, such as machine learning engineers and mathematicians for the former, and UX designers, software developers, data engineers for the latter, but also share music experts as a common denominator driving the evaluation efforts.</p>

Personalisation in generative music AI means the model/system can ingest your existing music - your favorite songs, your own compositions, or even just snippets of melodies you like - and use that information to create new music that aligns with the given style. This isn't about copying your music; it's about understanding your preferences for things like melody, harmony, and rhythm. The system effectively learns your 'musical fingerprint' and uses that to generate something fresh, but still feels like *your* kind of music. This feature helps ensure that the AI acts as an extension of your own creativity, rather than a generic music-making machine.</p>                        </div>                    </div>                                        <div class="card">                        <img class="card-img-top" src="assets/header_1.jpg">                        <div class="card-body">                            <h5 class="card-title">Creative Feedback (HITL)</h5>                            <p class="card-text">Users can guide the AI's music generation process by providing feedback as it creates.</p>                        </div>                        <div class="card-footer d-flex w-100 justify-content-between">                            <small class="text-muted">Feature 1-02</small>                            <small class="text-muted">Oversight</small>                        </div>                    </div>                    <div class="popup">                        <div class="popup-content">                            <span class="close-button">&times;</span>                            <h2>Creative Feedback (HITL)</h2>                            <p>Think of this like a jam session with an AI. Instead of just generating a complete piece of music in one go, the system allows you to provide feedback *during* the creation process. You might hear a melody it generated and say, "Make it a bit sadder," or "Change that chord to a minor key." The system then takes your feedback into account and adjusts the music accordingly. This is called Human-in-the-Loop (HITL). This iterative process ensures that you, the user, remain in control of the creative direction, shaping the music to fit your vision, step by step, as the AI learns from your guidance to achieve your musical goals.</p>                        </div>                    </div>                                        <div class="card">                        <img class="card-img-top" src="assets/header_1.jpg">                        <div class="card-body">                            <h5 class="card-title">Controllability (conditioning)</h5>                            <p class="card-text">Users can control the AI's music generation using various inputs, like text, melodies, or rhythms.</p>                        </div>                        <div class="card-footer d-flex w-100 justify-content-between">                            <small class="text-muted">Feature 1-03</small>                            <small class="text-muted">Oversight</small>                        </div>                    </div>                    <div class="popup">                        <div class="popup-content">                            <span class="close-button">&times;</span>                            <h2>Controllability (conditioning)</h2>                            <p>This feature is about giving you, the user, fine-grained control over the music the AI generates. Instead of just saying "make a pop song," you can provide specific instructions or initial inputs to follow (alias conditioning). You might give it a starting melody, specify a particular chord progression, set the tempo, or even describe the desired mood (e.g., "happy," "melancholy," "energetic"). The system uses these conditions as a starting point, and may also allow control the generation via different modes of interaction, such as humming a tune, or drawing a rhythmic pattern. This multi-modal approach gives you the power to sculpt the music in detail, making the AI a collaborative tool.</p>                        </div>                    </div>                                        <div class="card">                        <img class="card-img-top" src="assets/header_1.jpg">                        <div class="card-body">                            <h5 class="card-title">Red Button</h5>                            <p class="card-text">Users can immediately stop the AI if it starts generating something they don't like or find offensive.</p>                        </div>                        <div class="card-footer d-flex w-100 justify-content-between">                            <small class="text-muted">Feature 1-04</small>                            <small class="text-muted">Oversight</small>                        </div>                    </div>                    <div class="popup">                        <div class="popup-content">                            <span class="close-button">&times;</span>                            <h2>Red Button</h2>                            <p>This is a safety feature, like an emergency stop button. While generative AI aims to create enjoyable music, there's always a chance it might produce something unexpected, inappropriate, or even offensive to some categories of users. The 'Red Button' feature guarantees that you, the user, have ultimate control. If at any point you hear something you don't like - whether it's a jarring melody, disturbing sounds, or inappropriate lyrics - you can immediately stop the music generation. This ensures a safe and comfortable experience, preventing exposure to unwanted or potentially harmful content. It puts the power back in your hands, literally.</p>                        </div>                    </div>                                        <div class="card">                        <img class="card-img-top" src="assets/header_1.jpg">                        <div class="card-body">                            <h5 class="card-title">Safety Disclaimer</h5>                            <p class="card-text">The system warns users if it might generate music that could be considered offensive or harmful.</p>                        </div>                        <div class="card-footer d-flex w-100 justify-content-between">                            <small class="text-muted">Feature 1-05</small>                            <small class="text-muted">Agency</small>                        </div>                    </div>                    <div class="popup">                        <div class="popup-content">                            <span class="close-button">&times;</span>                            <h2>Safety Disclaimer</h2>                            <p>This is not preventing certain outputs, it is about making users aware of certain behaviours.

It's important to note that in many cases, full training data availability might not be possible due to copyright restrictions, but where feasible, it significantly enhances scientific openness.</p>                        </div>                    </div>                                        <div class="card">                        <img class="card-img-top" src="assets/header_2.jpg">                        <div class="card-body">                            <h5 class="card-title">Prompt-to-Gen</h5>                            <p class="card-text">If examples of AI-generated music are provided, the AI can be made to recreate those exact pieces.</p>                        </div>                        <div class="card-footer d-flex w-100 justify-content-between">                            <small class="text-muted">Feature 2-08</small>                            <small class="text-muted">Reproducibility</small>                        </div>                    </div>                    <div class="popup">                        <div class="popup-content">                            <span class="close-button">&times;</span>                            <h2>Prompt-to-Gen</h2>                            <p>This means that if the developers release examples of music generated by the system, they also provide the exact 'prompts' (instructions) and 'seeds' (random starting points) that were used.

This promotes honest and responsible decision-making in AI development.</p>                        </div>                    </div>                                        <div class="card">                        <img class="card-img-top" src="assets/header_7.jpg">                        <div class="card-body">                            <h5 class="card-title">Generative Redress</h5>                            <p class="card-text">If the system creates harmful or inappropriate output, there are ways to address the problem.</p>                        </div>                        <div class="card-footer d-flex w-100 justify-content-between">                            <small class="text-muted">Feature 7-04</small>                            <small class="text-muted">Redress</small>                        </div>                    </div>                    <div class="popup">                        <div class="popup-content">                            <span class="close-button">&times;</span>                            <h2>Generative Redress</h2>                            <p>Despite best efforts, things can still go wrong. This feature addresses what happens *after* a negative impact has occurred. It means having mechanisms in place to provide redress - to make amends for the harm caused. This could involve: (1) **Compensation:** Providing financial compensation to someone harmed by copyright infringement. (2) **Correction:** Allowing users to directly modify or remove offensive content generated by the system. (3) **Apology:** Issuing a public apology for the harm caused. (4) **System Modification:** Updating the system to prevent similar incidents in the future. The specific form of redress will depend on the nature of the harm, but the key is having a plan in place to address negative consequences fairly and effectively.</p>                        </div>                    </div>                                    </div>            <!-- End Card Group -->            </section>            <div class="section-divider"></div>
