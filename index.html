        <p class="mb-0">Generative AI is radically changing the creative arts, transforming the way we create and
          interact with cultural artefacts.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>While offering unprecedented opportunities for artistic expression, this technology also raises ethical,
        societal, and legal concerns. Key among these are the potential displacement of human creativity, copyright
        infringement stemming from vast training datasets, and the lack of transparency, explainability, and fairness
        mechanisms. In response to this, a coalition of organisations representing creative industries formed the <a
          class="lolink" href="https://www.humanartistrycampaign.com">Human Artistry Campaign</a>, advocating on behalf
        of the responsible use of creative AI. As generative systems become pervasive in this domain, responsible design
        is crucial.</p>

      <p><span class="font-weight-bold">Responsible AI Music</span> (RAIM) is a collaborative initiative bringing
        together musicians, AI experts, ethicists, and legal experts to define, expand, and monitor requirements for
        generative music AI. Our goal is to work towards a framework providing guidance on the responsible development
        and use of generative models and system for music. By balancing innovation with ethical considerations, we
        advocate for a tradeoff where artists and AI development collaborate in a way that <span
          class="font-italic">safeguards</span>, <span class="font-italic">inspires</span>, and <span
          class="font-italic">augments</span> human creativity and artistry.</p>

      <p><span class="font-weight-bold">Can this be done by leveraging a Trustworthy AI framework?</span> This
        initiative takes a holistic approach, harmonising previous work that has tackled specific aspects of generative
        systems (e.g., transparency, evaluation, data), within the Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI produced by the
        European Commission - a framework for designing responsible AI systems across 7 macro requirements. Focusing on
        generative music AI, we illustrate how these requirements can be contextualised for the field, addressing
        trustworthiness across multiple dimensions and integrating insights from the existing literature.</p>

      <h2>What is Trustworthy AI?</h2>
      <div class="row">

          <p>Trustworthy AI encompasses artificial intelligence systems designed and implemented to adhere to
            fundamental ethical principles, technical robustness, and legal compliance.
            A referential work in this domain are the <a
              href="https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/d3988569-0434-11ea-8c1f-01aa75ed71a1">Ethics

              Artificial Intelligence</a>, an independent expert group appointed by the European Commission in 2018.</p>
          <p>The guidelines include 7 key requirements that AI systems should meet to be trustworthy:
          <ol>
            <li>Human agency and oversight</li>
            <li>Robustness and safety</li>

          </ol>
          These requirements are of general applicability and relate to different stakeholders in the systems' life

      <h2>Guiding features for Responsible AI Music</h2>
      <p>We contextualise the Trustworthy AI framework to the domain of Generative AI Music, by defining responsible
        features that can drive the design and the evaluation of generative systems, in accordance with the literature.
      </p>
      <img src="assets/feature_diagram.png" class="img-fluid my-2" alt="Overview of features">

      <p>Before presenting each feature, let's start by introducing some jargon. When referring to Music AIs, a
        distinction needs to be made between <span class="font-italic">music model</span> and <span
          class="font-italic">generative music system</span>.
      <ul>
        <li>
          A music <span class="font-weight-bold">model</span> can be defined as an algorithmic procedure that either
          encodes a set of rules explicitly, or learns them from the data and the task it is provided. These rules,
          e.g., a probability distribution for predicting the next note or chord in a piece, or a set of logical
          statements, can be used to generate, complete, or manipulate music.
        </li>
        <li>
          A generative music <span class="font-weight-bold">system</span> encompasses the whole computational
          infrastructure built on top of a music model to enable users to interact with the model and make use of its
          outputs, without the need of its inner workings. This includes both technical and the regulatory aspects, such
          as the interface, the logic which abstract or hide certain parameters of the model, the way the model's
          predictions are consumed; but also the data management system, the legal framework regulating the exchange of
          data, etc.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Typically, a generative system is implemented in such a way as to conveniently wrap the functionalities of a
        particular model, meaning that a model can provide the computational backbone to various generative systems
        (e.g., plugins for music editors, production environments, smart instruments).
        For example, <a href="https://magenta.tensorflow.org/music-vae">MusicVAE</a> has been reused in different
        applications, such as Beat Blender, Melody Mixer, Latent Loops, and is also available through <a
          href="https://magenta.tensorflow.org/studio/">Magenta Studio</a>, a plugin for the DAW Ableton Live.
        The distinction between model and system is a peculiar aspect to Generative AI, as their design and
        implementation involve different stakeholders, such as machine learning engineers and mathematicians for the
        former, and UX designers, software developers, data engineers for the latter, but also share music experts as a
        common denominator driving the evaluation efforts.</p>

      <h3>Pillar 1: Human Agency and Oversight</h3>
      <p>Central to the design of trustworthy systems is the capacity of individuals to understand and meaningfully
        influence the actions of AI systems (<em>human agency</em>) while monitoring and interacting their behaviour to
        operate responsibly and align with human values and preferences (<em>human oversight</em>).</p>

            <h2>Personalisation</h2>
            <p>Imagine having a musical collaborator that learns your unique style. Personalisation in generative music
              AI means the model/system can ingest your existing music - your favorite songs, your own compositions, or
              even just snippets of melodies you like - and use that information to create new music that aligns with
              the given style. This isn't about copying your music; it's about understanding your preferences for things
              like melody, harmony, and rhythm. The system effectively learns your 'musical fingerprint' and uses that
              to generate something fresh, but still feels like *your* kind of music. This feature helps ensure that the
              AI acts as an extension of your own creativity, rather than a generic music-making machine.</p>

            <h2>Creative feedback (HITL)</h2>
            <p>Think of this like a jam session with an AI. Instead of just generating a complete piece of music in one
              go, the system allows you to provide feedback *during* the creation process. You might hear a melody it
              generated and say, "Make it a bit sadder," or "Change that chord to a minor key." The system then takes
              your feedback into account and adjusts the music accordingly. This is called Human-in-the-Loop (HITL).
              This iterative process ensures that you, the user, remain in control of the creative direction, shaping
              the music to fit your vision, step by step, as the AI learns from your guidance to achieve your musical
              goals.</p>

            <h2>Controllability (conditioning)</h2>
            <p>This feature is about giving you, the user, fine-grained control over the music the AI generates. Instead
              of just saying "make a pop song," you can provide specific instructions or initial inputs to follow (alias
              conditioning). You might give it a starting melody, specify a particular chord progression, set the tempo,
              or even describe the desired mood (e.g., "happy," "melancholy," "energetic"). The system uses these
              conditions as a starting point, and may also allow control the generation via different modes of
              interaction, such as humming a tune, or drawing a rhythmic pattern. This multi-modal approach gives you
              the power to sculpt the music in detail, making the AI a collaborative tool.</p>

            <h2>Red button</h2>
            <p>This is a safety feature, like an emergency stop button. While generative AI aims to create enjoyable
              music, there's always a chance it might produce something unexpected, inappropriate, or even offensive to
              some categories of users. The 'Red Button' feature guarantees that you, the user, have ultimate control.
              If at any point you hear something you don't like - whether it's a jarring melody, disturbing sounds, or
              inappropriate lyrics - you can immediately stop the music generation. This ensures a safe and comfortable
              experience, preventing exposure to unwanted or potentially harmful content. It puts the power back in your
              hands, literally.</p>

              feature ensures that you're aware of the *potential* for the system to generate music that some might find
              offensive or inappropriate. Before you start using the system, or when you select certain options, it will
              provide a clear disclaimer. This might say something like, "This system may generate lyrics containing
              strong language," or "The music generated might be experimental and include dissonant sounds." This allows
              you to make an informed decision about whether and how to use the system, especially if you're sensitive

            <p>This feature emphasises the importance of human expertise in shaping AI tools for music. It means that
              the system wasn't just created by programmers in isolation; musicians, composers, and other creative
              professionals were actively involved in the design and development process. This is a form of
              Human-on-the-Loop (HOTL) approach. Their input helps ensure that the system is actually useful and
              relevant to artists, that it meets their needs, and that it aligns with artistic values. This
              collaboration helps to avoid creating a tool that's technically impressive but artistically irrelevant or
              even harmful to the creative process. It bridges the gap between technology and art.</p>

              a large dataset of music. This feature ensures the system doesn't simply memorise and regurgitate pieces
              of that training data. It should generate *new* music, not copy existing works. If, for some reason, the
              system *does* reproduce part of its training data, it must be transparent about this and only do so with
              the explicit permission of the copyright holders. This prevents plagiarism and respects the rights of the

              switch to a safer, more predictable mode of generation. This 'rule-based mode' might be less
              sophisticated, perhaps playing pre-programmed sequences or simple melodies, but it guarantees that the
              output remains appropriate while the issue with the main generative model is addressed. It's like having a

              musicians, composers, or musicologists - people with deep musical knowledge and experience - to listen to
              the generated music and provide their expert opinions. This provides a valuable qualitative perspective,

              was trained and how it generates music - is thoroughly documented. This documentation should be clear,

            <h2>Continuous assessment</h2>
            <p>Responsible AI development is not a one-time effort; it requires ongoing monitoring and evaluation. This feature emphasises the importance of involving a diverse group of stakeholders - musicians, composers, ethicists, AI experts, and potentially even representatives from different cultural groups - in a continuous process of assessing the system. This ongoing feedback loop helps to: (1) Identify and address any emerging biases or unintended consequences. (2) Ensure the system remains aligned with ethical principles and societal values. (3) Improve the system's performance and usefulness over time. It's a commitment to long-term responsibility and continuous improvement.</p>

            <p>Training large AI models can require significant computational resources, leading to substantial energy consumption and environmental impact. This feature promotes transparency about this 'training footprint.' It means providing information about: (1) The type of hardware used (e.g., GPUs). (2) The duration of the training process. (3) The estimated energy consumption (often expressed in kilowatt-hours or equivalent CO2 emissions). This allows users and researchers to assess the environmental cost of training the model and encourages developers to find ways to minimise this footprint.</p>

            <p>What is the environmental cost of generating a song? While training has a large upfront environmental cost, *using* the trained model (called 'inference') also consumes energy. This feature focuses on the environmental cost of *generating* music. Ideally, the system would provide an estimate of the energy used per generation, or perhaps per minute of generated music. This is often much lower than the training cost, but it can still be significant, especially if the system is used very frequently or at a large scale. This transparency encourages responsible use and motivates developers to optimise for energy efficiency during inference.</p>

If the system generates revenue (e.g., through subscriptions or licensing fees), this feature proposes that a portion of that revenue should be shared with the artists whose music was used to train the AI. This is a challenging problem, as it's difficult to determine exactly *how much* each artist contributed to the success of the system. However, exploring models for revenue sharing is a crucial step towards ensuring that AI development benefits not just the technology companies, but also the creative community whose work makes it possible. This might involve creating a fund, developing a licensing scheme, or other innovative solutions.</p>
