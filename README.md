# Responsible AI Music (RAIM) Initiative

[![Website](https://img.shields.io/badge/Website-Live-brightgreen.svg)](https://amlab.github.io/raim-initiative)

This repository hosts the website and resources for the Responsible AI Music (RAIM) initiative. RAIM is a collaborative effort to define, expand, and monitor requirements for generative music AI, ensuring the future of music creation aligns with Trustworthy AI principles.

## About RAIM

Generative AI is revolutionizing the creative arts, offering unprecedented opportunities but also raising serious concerns. RAIM brings together musicians, AI experts, ethicists, and legal professionals to create a framework for the responsible development and deployment of generative music models and systems. We leverage the Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI from the European Commission as a foundation, contextualising its seven key requirements for the specific domain of music generation.

**Our goal is to lay the foundations for a RAIM framework aiming to:**

*   **Safeguard, inspire, and augment human creativity.**
*   **Balance innovation with ethical considerations.**
*   **Promote collaboration between artists and AI developers.**
*   **Provide clear guidance on responsible AI music practices.**
*   **Integrate insights from existing literature on generative AI.**

## Getting Involved

We actively encourage participation from a diverse range of stakeholders:

*   **AI Researchers:** Contribute your expertise in generative models, evaluation metrics, and responsible AI development.
*   **Ethicists:** Help us navigate the complex ethical landscape of AI-generated music.
*   **Legal Experts:**  Provide guidance on copyright, intellectual property, and data privacy.
*   **Music Professionals:** Share your insights on the impact of AI on the creative process and the music industry.
*   **Policymakers:**  Inform the development of regulations and policies that support responsible innovation.
*   **Civil Society Organisations:** Advocate for the responsible use of AI in the creative arts.
